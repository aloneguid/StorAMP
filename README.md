What can you do with StorAmp? Here is a brief list of features.

## Fast Navigation Experience
You can view any storage account folders and files in a Norton Commander style view. It's blazing fast unlike any Electron based viewers.

## Viewing and Editing Files Inline
StorAMP allows you to view files inline, without downloading them locally. Just press the "view" button on the toolbar. In addition to that, you can edit the file as well.

It supports syntax highlighting for most popular file formats i.e. markdown, json, xml, css, html, most programming languages (C#, Java, JavaScript (not sure it's a programming language), Scala and many others). If you like us to support more, just raise an issue here.

## Drag and Drop from Windows Explorer to Upload Files

It's as easy as that, just drag a file or set of files to upload them to the storage.

## Drag and Drop between storage panes

Same goes for copying files between storage accounts - simply drag'n'drop.
